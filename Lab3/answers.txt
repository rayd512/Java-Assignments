1. Static is used to allow use to use main without instantiating the class. Without the static, the program will not execute what is in main

2. Factory Pattern, user can instantiate many objects from the factory without even knowing what the object is

3. Design patterns provide solution to instantiate a object in the best possible way for specific situations. You also want to localize the logic to instantiate a complex object. Makes complicated objects less complicated by simplifying them down.

This provides a layer of abstraction between the user and the program. It is better for the user as it simplifies it for them and also simplifies it for the program as well.
